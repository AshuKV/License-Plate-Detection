# License-Plate-Detection
Automatic License Plate Detection using YOLOv4 and Darknet


## Files


```Bounding_Box_Visualization.ipynb``` contains the notebook to view the analysis of bounding-box prediction model.


```Plate_Detection_YOLOV4_Darknet_.ipynb``` contains the notebook to view the best-evaluated Yolov4 model.


## Approach



## Result

### License Plate Detection Using OCR and Pytesseract Library

### Helmet detection using YoloV3 model(Pytorch):

### Automatic Detection of Bike Rider without Helmet using TensorFlow API:



## Conclusion

- A  centroid tracking  method  was  also  proposed  to  reduce  the  number  of false  positives  generated  by  the  helmeted  bikers  when  their helmet is out of video frame.
- Chances of death due to road accident will reduce.
- Real-world video surveillance system that can effectively detect moving person using limited resources.
